# Retail-trade-report-for-the-US-market

A US‐based online retailer wants to launch a new product category and wants to understand the potential growth areas and areas that have stagnated over a period of time. It wants to use this information to ensure its product focus is aligned to opportunities that will grow over the next 5–7 years. The customer has also provided pointers to the data set you can use. The following are the goals for the project:

‐ Analyze the entire data set and arrive at products that have experienced a consolidated yearly avg growth of 10% or more in sales since 2000.

‐ Analyze the entire data set and arrive at products that have experienced a consolidated yearly avg drop of 5% or more since 2000.

- Find top 5 products and bottom 5 products of overall sales for 3 years.
